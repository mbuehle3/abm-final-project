# Agent Based Modeling Final Project
## Indigo Snake Home Rage Size

## Introduction

*Drymarchon couperi*, commonly known as the eastern indigo snake, is a federally protected species of colubrid endemic to the southeastern United States.
The decline of the species has been linked to the destruction of its primary habitat, longleaf pine forests. 
Due to its conservation status, conservation efforts have focused heavily on better understanding the ecology and natural history of this enigmatic species. 
One of the most striking characteristics of the species natural history is the massive home range size and variation in size across the species range. 
In southern Georgia at Fort Stewart, individual male indigo snakes were radio-tracked across the landscape and had homeranges as large as 1,500 hectacres.
In contrast, individuals from Florida tend to have much smaller homeranges, typically ~150 hectacres. 

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to use an agent based modeling approach to explore which biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the average home range size of an indigo snake population.

## Model Parameters

* Population Density
* Mate Pursuit
* Energy Availability
* Burrow Availability (?)
* Philopatry / Age (?)
* Movement 
## Agent Parameters

* Sex 
* Energy Status


## Thinking About Output

* Track the number of movements in the square model, use this as a proxy for the home range size

* In the landscape movement, track exact points, measure linear distance moved as well as the area inside the perimeter
## Current Status

I am working on the movement functions and will talk to you in class about them. 

Once I have the movement functions more solidified I am going to start tracking output and figuring out how to interpret results.
